						<h3>Let's Talk About Money</h3>
						<p><i>"Invoices are by far the worst part of working with you."</i> It's true, but to be fair, I don't like discussing money either. It's my least favorite part of this process.</p>
						
						<p>You outsource help for one of two reasons: (1) For something you cannot do or (2) For something you do not <i>want</i> to do. You may feel unable to effectively communicate what it is you’re trying to say. Conversely, you may realize your time is better spent elsewhere. Either way, it’s only fair to pay for an objective party to join you in thinking through the best possible solution for you, your audience and your brand. Let’s not grumble. <a href="mailto:stephanie.rachmeler@icloud.com">Let's create.</a></p></div>
					<div class="col-8">
						<h3>I Think Business Cards Are Important</h3>
						<p>Why are business cards important? Because relationships matter. “No man is an island” is true both personally, and especially professionally. Why should anyone want to work with you over someone equally accomplished? Because they like you better. Why? It doesn’t matter. Whatever the reason, you’ve established a relationship and in doing so, earned his or her loyalty. Loyalty means return customers and new referrals. It’s not something to be taken lightly. Much like a marriage, professional relationships take continuous work. Don’t take it for granted.</p>		
						
						<p>Marriage is preceded by dating, and dating begins by first getting noticed. You are awesome at what you do, you keep up with current trends and on top of that you’re a nice person, but Prince Charming is never going to notice you if you don’t stand out from all the other would-be princesses out there.</p>		
						
						<p>Enter the business card. This 3.5”x2” piece of paper is all Prince Charming has left of you when the clock strikes midnight. Cinderella’s glass slipper was a pretty unique calling card and so too must your business card be just as unique and memorable an artifact to help customers find you again.</p>	
						
						<p>In a sea of overly-used template-designed business cards, what will make yours stand out? Many cards are printed digitally for its cost-effectiveness. However, if your card is 2 colors or less, consider offset printing. Offset, like letterpress, uses a plate to transfer the ink to the paper. This gives you solid coverage of color versus the dot pattern (poor) digital printing does. You put effort in your appearance. Do the same for your card.</p>
						
						<p>Here’s something to consider: Cognition follows a three step sequence - Shape, Color and Form. You’re going to remember the shape of an object first, then it’s color and finally what it says. Consider rounded corners, a unique cut-out, colored stock versus the traditional white, or a specialty printing process. When a potential client is perusing their box o’ cards looking for yours, even if they’ve forgotten your name, they’re going to remember “it’s a dark blue card with yellow edges and rounded corners."</p>
						
						<p>Every detail counts. Have your business cards custom designed to your business. Doing so tells current and prospective customers that details matter to you and attention to detail is something they can expect doing business with you.</p>
						
						<p>The bottom line: You card should represent the effort you put towards your business, the unparalleled service it offers, and the attention-to-detail that makes your company the right choice for your customers.</p></div>
