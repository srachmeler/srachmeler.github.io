				<h4>Why</h4>
				<h1>We live with a lot of unnecessary noise. I want to help change that by working towards a world of fewer, better things.</h1></div></div>

			<div class="panel-1 clearfix">
				<div class="content-wrapper">
					<div class="col-4"><h2>Your brand has a message. The purpose of design is to <i>effectively communicate</i> it. To do this, keep what supports your message and edit the rest.</h2></div>

						<div class="col-12"><h3>Clutter</h3><h6><i>noun</i><br>1. A state or condition of confusion;<br>2. Confused noise, clatter;<br>3. Mess, disorder, jumble.</h6></div>
						<div class="col-12"><h3>Visual clutter creates actual clutter</h3><p>A visually cluttered page, as stated above, is noisy and tells your audience you are unsure of what it is that you're trying to say. This uncertainty leaves room for several rounds of avoidable adjustments, which can lead to <i>actual</i> clutter in your office. </p></div>
						<div class="col-12"><h3>There's no such thing as a confused audience</h3><p>If you confuse your audience, you will no longer have one. Eliminate the noise. A strong design is one that delivers a clear and digestible message, which in turn, creates a responsive and loyal audience.</p></div></div><a class="left img-link" href="#What"><h3 class="arrow"></h3></a></div><p><a id="What"></a></p></div></div>

Hundreds of hours and trials and errors are required to create such an impactful experience. Similarly, your brand is the result of time and effort to create an experience from which others will benefit and enjoy.</p></div>
					<div class="col-12"><h3>Hide In Plain Sight</h3><p>Your visual identity should go unnoticed because it makes so much sense that your audience cannot imagine it any other way. Don’t stand out from the crowd because you draw too much attention to yourself. Stand out because you don’t stand out.</p></div>
