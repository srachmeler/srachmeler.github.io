						<h3>Visual clutter creates actual clutter</h3>
						<p>Visual clutter is noisy and tells your audience you're unsure of what you're trying to say. This uncertainty leaves room for avoidable adjustments, which can lead to <i>actual</i> clutter in your office.</p></div>
				
					<div class="spacing">
						<h3>There's no such thing as a confused audience</h3>
						<p>Eliminate the noise. If you confuse your audience, you will lose them. A strong design delivers a clear and digestible message and creates a loyal and responsive audience.</p></div></div></div></div>

						<h3>Make It Positive</h3>
						<p>What makes a positive experience? <strong>Listening.</strong> You want to feel that you have been heard and that your concerns have been addressed. The same is true for your audience.</p></div>

					<div class="spacing">
						<h3>Keep It Simple</h3>
						<p>Simple is neither plain nor boring, and it is anything but easy. Simple is a ballet dancer. Hundreds of hours of trials and errors are required to create such an impactful experience. Your brand is similarly the result of time and effort to create a beneficial and enjoyable experience.</p></div>

					<div class="spacing">
						<h3>Hide In Plain Sight</h3>
						<p>Your visual identity should go unnoticed because it makes so much sense that your audience cannot imagine it any other way. Don’t stand out from the crowd because you draw too much attention to yourself. Stand out because you don’t stand out.</p></div></div></div></div>
