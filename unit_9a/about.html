				<h4>Why</h4>
				<h1>I want to reduce the clutter and create a world of fewer, better things.</h1></div></div>

			<div class="panel-sm-3 clearfix">
				<h2 class="center">Three Important Questions</h2>
				<div class="col-4">
					<h3>Clutter</h3>
					<p><i>noun</i><br>A state or condition of confusion; confused noise, clatter; mess, disorder, jumble.<br><p>From the 1570s: "things lying in heaps or confusion."</p></div>
				<div class="col-4">
					<h3>Excess or Efficiency?</h3><p>You can't have both. Like excess baggage, extraneous elements and poor planning weigh down your message and create a cumbersome experience for you and your audience.</p></div>
				<div class="col-4">
					<h3>You Can, But Should You?</h3><p>Eliminate the noise. A clear message is approachable, understandable and digestible. A clear design creates a responsive audience.</p></div></div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12 center title clearfix">
					<h4>What</h4><h1>The purpose of design is to create a positive experience for you and the person after you. If you agree, <a href="mailto:stephanie.rachmeler@icloud.com">reach out</a>.</h1></div></div>

			<div class="panel-2 clearfix">
				<h2 class="center">Simplicity. Invisibility. Goal 3</h2>
				<div class="col-4">
					<h3>A Simple Approach</h3>
					<p>Simple is neither plain nor boring, and is anything but easy. Simple is a ballet dancer. Hundreds of hours and many trials and errors are required to create such an impactful experience. Your brand, like a ballet dancer, is the result of similar time and energy to create an experience from which others will benefit and enjoy.</p></div>
				<div class="col-4">
					<h3>Hide In Plain Sight</h3>
					<p>The goal of your visual identity is visibility from invisibility. Your visual identity should go unnoticed because it makes so much sense, and your audience cannot imagine it any other way. Don’t stand out from the crowd for garishly drawing too much attention to yourself. Stand out because you don’t stand out.</p></div>

			<h1>Design isn't about execution.<br> It's a strategy.</h1></div></div>

			<h2 class="center">Design Is A Way Of Thinking</h2>

					<figure class="clearfix"><div class="col-12">
						<h3>The root of my strategy is organization.</h3> <p>Grouping like elements simplifies the complex. Much like sculpting in marble, you don't carve the details before you have the shape.</p></div></figure>
