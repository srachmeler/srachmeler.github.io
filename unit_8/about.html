			<h1>The best way to work it out is in words. If the words don't make sense, neither will the pictures.</h1>

			<h3>Much to the surprise of everyone, myself included, I've come to enjoy writing. Writing, like most anything else, requires a level of organization to be successful. I'm at my clearest when expressing myself verbally on the page. Below are some of the ideas meandering about my brain.</h3>

			<h2>I Think Business Cards Are Important</h2>
			</aside>
			<article class="columns">
				<p>Why are business cards important? Because relationships matter. “No man is an island” is true both personally, and especially professionally. Why should anyone want to work with you over someone equally accomplished? Because they like you better. Why? It doesn’t matter. Whatever the reason, you’ve established a relationship and in doing so, earned his or her loyalty. Loyalty means return customers and new referrals. It’s not something to be taken lightly. Much like a marriage, professional relationships take continuous work. Don’t take it for granted.</p>
			
				<p>Marriage is preceded by dating, and dating begins by first getting noticed. You are awesome at what you do, you keep up with current trends and on top of that you’re a nice person, but Prince Charming is never going to notice you if you don’t stand out from all the other would-be princesses out there.</p>
		
				<p>Enter the business card. This 3.5”x2” piece of paper is all Prince Charming has left of you when the clock strikes midnight. Cinderella’s glass slipper was a pretty unique calling card and so too must your business card be just as unique and memorable an artifact to help customers find you again.</p>
		
				<p>In a sea of overly-used template-designed business cards, what will make yours stand out? Many cards are printed digitally for its cost-effectiveness. However, if your card is 2 colors or less, consider offset printing. Offset, like letterpress, uses a plate to transfer the ink to the paper. This gives you solid coverage of color versus the dot pattern (poor) digital printing does. You put effort in your appearance. Do the same for your card.</p>

				<p>Here’s something to consider: Cognition follows a three step sequence - Shape, Color and Form. You’re going to remember the shape of an object first, then it’s color and finally what it says. Consider rounded corners, a unique cut-out, colored stock versus the traditional white, or a specialty printing process. When a potential client is perusing their box o’ cards looking for yours, even if they’ve forgotten your name, they’re going to remember “it’s a dark blue card with yellow edges and rounded corners."</p>

				<p>Every detail counts. Have your business cards custom designed to your business. Doing so tells current and prospective customers that details matter to you and attention to detail is something they can expect doing business with you.</p>
			
				<p>The bottom line: You card should represent the effort you put towards your business, the unparalleled service it offers, and the attention-to-detail that makes your company the right choice for your customers.</p>

				<h2>I Think Money Is A Necessary Evil, But Grumbling About It Doesn't Need To Be</h2>
			</aside>
			<article class="columns">
				<img src="images/PricingHeader.jpg" alt="Invoices are by far the worst part of working with you" title="An actual message from a client">

				<p>It's true, but to be fair, I don't like discussing money either. It's my least favorite part of the process.</p>

				<p>Why <i>does</i> it cost so much? Simply, design is paying an objective party to join you in thinking through the best possible solution for your situation, because it helps to have someone ask the questions that you forgot to ask. Questions like:</p>
		
				<ul>
					<li class="list-title">Who?</li>
					<li>Who are you as a brand?</li>
					<li>Who are you trying to reach?</li>
					<br>
					<li class="list-title">What?</li>
					<li>What is the problem you are solving?</li>
					<li>What does your audience value?</li>
					<li>What makes you different?</li>
					<br>
					<li class="list-title">Where?</li>
					<li>Where will your audience interact with you?</li>	
					<li>Where does your audience get information?</li>
					<li>Where do you see your business in five years? In ten?</li>
					<br>
					<li class="list-title">When?</li>
					<li>When was your "Aha!" moment?</li>
					<br>
					<li class="list-title">Why?</li>
					<li>Why is your business relevant?</li>
					<li>Why should anyone hire you?</li>
					<br>
					<li class="list-title">How?</li>
					<li>How old is your audience?</li>
					<li>How do they feel?</li>
					<li>How do they shop?</li>
					<li>How do they commute?</li>
					<li>How do they communicate?</li>
					<li>How does your audience interact with you?</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>You outsource help for one of two reasons: (1) For something you cannot do or (2) For something you do not <i>want</i> to do. You may feel unable to effectively communicate what it is you’re trying to say. Conversely, you may realize your time is better spent elsewhere. Either way, it’s only fair to pay for help.
